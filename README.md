# Perfect-State-Transfer-in-Quantum-Spin-Chains
This code allows for perfect state transfer and early state exclusion to be modeled for a given spectrum of eigenvalues corresponding to the Hamiltonian of a quantum spin chain. 
A sample 7 qubit spin chain with symmetric spectra -7, -4, -1, 0, 1, 4, 7 is given.

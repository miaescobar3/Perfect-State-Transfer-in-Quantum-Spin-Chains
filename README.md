# Perfect-State-Transfer-in-Quantum-Spin-Chains
This code models perfect state transfer (PST) and early state exclusion (ESE) for a given spectrum of eigenvalues corresponding to the Hamiltonian of a quantum spin chain. 
A sample 7 qubit spin chain with symmetric spectra -7, -4, -3, 0, 3, 4, 7 is given. This spectrum demonstrates both PST and ESE.
